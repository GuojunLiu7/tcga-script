# tcga-script

The scripts are used to download RNAseq data, patient metadata, sample metadata from [GDC/TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)

## Download
- step_1.py: download clinical and sample metadata.
- TCGA_file_download.py: download RNAseq files.
- generate_gene_matrix.py: generate gene matrix: (sample id, gene id)

## Clinical and biospeciman
- Biospeciman_extract.py: Extract biospeciman information under sample level, and keep samplet_type, bcr_sample_barcode_bcr_sample_uuid under a "-biospecimen-matrix"
- Clinical_extract.py: Extracted patient information. The filters for each project is in clinical_file_extract_filter.py
- basic_matrix.py: Get basic information about sample from the gdc website directly (due to some inconsistency between website and clinical metadata file)
- Reindex_gene_matrix.py: Reindex gene matrix with sample barcode
- Reindex_clinical_matrix.py: Combine biospecimen matrix, clinical matrix and reindex with sample barcode

## Plot
- Gene_expression_plot_each.py: Generate KM plots for every subgroups for gene in a genelist file, and generate a summary file.
- heatmap.py: Generate heatmap from the summary file generated by Gene_expression_plot_each.py
